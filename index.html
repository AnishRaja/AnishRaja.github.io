        <p class="subtitle">A similar study was conducted by Iowa State University in 1991 in which 605 students were surveyed. Their study suggested that there was a strong + correlation between grade level and difficulty of history courses.</p>

    <br>

        <h4>Why Iowa State University’s data suggests a stronger correlation compared to Dublin Coffman High School’s data</h4>
    <br>
        <p>- More students were surveyed </p>
        <p>- There was an equal amount of students surveyed from each grade  </p>
        <p>- The data was analyzed and gathered in a more professional manner compared to the survey taken in Dublin Coffman High School </p>
