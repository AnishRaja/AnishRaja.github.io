            <p>People today think that as grade level increases, so does the course difficulty. They believe that students should put more time and effort into their work, but does this belief apply towards history subjects too? The results were expected to show a strong correlation between grade level and course difficulty, meaning that as grade level increases, so does the course difficulty. To find out whether this hypothesis was true, a survey was conducted at Dublin Coffman High School. Fifty-six students from grades nine through twelve were surveyed, requiring the students to give their grade level and describe how hard they thought their history course was. The results were gathered and  the data suggested that there was a linear correlation of .5238. This correlation was moderate and did not meet the expected results</p>

        <p class="subtitle">A similar study was conducted by Iowa State University in 1991 in which 605 students were surveyed. Their study suggested that there was a strong + correlation between grade level and difficulty of history courses.</p>

    <br>

        <h4>Why Iowa State University’s data suggests a stronger correlation compared to Dublin Coffman High School’s data</h4>
    <br>
        <p>- More students were surveyed </p>
        <p>- The survey’s main focus was on the data rather than the correlation </p>
        <p>- The data was analyzed and gathered in a more professional manner compared to the survey taken in Dublin Coffman High School </p>
